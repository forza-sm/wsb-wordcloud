To get around it I usually purchase something at big loss the day before and sell it the next day to avoid the penalty. 

You can also sell first and still buy without activating the day trade rule.  

So for example Sundial drops 15% in one day, I'd try to buy it at the low and flip it for 5% usually at opening the next day. Rinse repeat. 

After losing 60% on gamestop this has helped me almost get back positive and should be green after the next couple weeks.

277,"What is the Pattern Day Trade Rule?  
Pattern Day Trade rule also known as PDT is in place to protect the beginner traders. It is important to know this rule if you have less than $25,000 in your bank account or trading account and you are an active trader.  
The rule states if you are an active trader, meaning if you make 4 or more trades in a 5 day period, then you will be stuck in your fourth trade place. Therefore you won’t be able to make any more trades until your early trades are cleared.  For example, if you made two trades on Monday, one on Tuesday, and one on Wednesday, you won’t be able to make a trade on Thursday; therefore, if the market is crashing, you will be stuck in that place.  
It is the law; you can call your broker, but they won’t be able to do anything for you as they are bound by these regulations by the SEC.  
When can PDT be a problem?  
Let’s say you are entering a position with a hundred chairs, and then you are selling on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. You won’t be able to trade if you spot something better because you stocked up your four positions already. That’s the one main problem with Pattern Day Trade, you have to be aware of it, if you have less than $25,000 in your account and you are an active trader.  
How to avoid PDT  
One way to avoid the Pattern Day Trade rule is to set up two or more brokerage accounts. Let’s say you have $20,000 in your account, and have one account at Scottrade, Option House, and have a third account at Trade King. This will allow you to have four trades on each of those brokerage accounts, which will give you about 12 trades total.  
Again, you will have to be cautious when trading, but then you will also have to worry about managing all logins, trades, and making sure your amount does not reach $25,000. However, this way is great because it will allow you to trade more actively. As many people use this way to avoid the Pattern Day Trade rule.  
What happens if you have more than $25,000?  
Now if you have more than $25,000 in your account you will get flagged as a Pattern Day Trade. Your margin requirements will be slightly higher because they think you are a bit more risky, but don’t worry there is nothing to worry about.  
If your account drops below $25,000, you will again be bounded by the PDT rule. Just be aware of the pattern day trader rule because it is in place to protect beginner traders.",1622851312.0

327,"Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share. 🐴👍",1622854886.0

What Is a Pattern Day Trader (PDT)?  
A pattern day trader (PDT) is a regulatory designation for those traders or investors that execute four or more day trades over the span of five business days using a margin account. The number of day trades must constitute more than 6% of the margin account's total trade activity during that five-day window.  
  
If this occurs, the trader's account will be flagged as a PDT by their broker. The PDT designation places certain restrictions on further trading; this designation is put in place to discourage investors from trading excessively.",1622850664.0

810,">Basically he's saying if you put your cash into stocks you free to day trade 5 million times as long as your balance is there.

This is the key here, and people have to read this carefully and match it with the FINRA Pattern Day Trading rules, and how stocks actually settle.

It takes **two days** for trade to settle in the U.S. and most other places. If you sell your stock and the money shows up instantly in your account, *the broker is loaning you that money until your stock sale clears in two days*, at which time they'll take the money on your behalf as you already have it.

That means you are borrowing on that account, and thus are subject to Margin Account rules for Pattern Day Trading. It is the same as if you borrowed actual money to go leverage long, or get in a short position, at least in the eyes of FINRA.

If you sell your stock and you have to wait two days for the money to show up, you are on a Cash Account. After those two days you can buy a stock and sell it again within 5 seconds if you want, you have to wait another two days anyway.

What FINRA **doesn't** care about, is if you have $100 in your account, buy then sell a position, then immediately add another $100 to your account and buy another $100 position in the same or other stock. In that case you're not using the money waiting to be settled, you're using already settled cash in the account (assuming the transfer was completed without instant loaning). 

You can do that as much as you want, as long as you're using settled cash they don't give a shit since you're only going to hurt yourself.",1622835964.0

923,"I think its dependent upon how long you hold the position.. If you buy and sell within the same day you would have to wait for the funds to settle, because the funds from the purchase havent settled yet. If you hold for a few days then it will have settled by then so the money will be available to you after you sell. 

at least thats my understanding of it, I could be wrong",1622847243.0

928,Is your account instant or gold? And all of us told you all to stay away from Robinghood tbh. If your account isn't a cash only account on Robinhood you are subject to the PDT rule. Read my clicky for more information. If you are gold or instant your account is basically a margin acc and if you deposit x money and use said instant deposit to buy gme and it gets super volatile they technically can margin call you and make you sell at a loss potentially,1622833870.0

IV spiked and the stock went to 47 after hours blowing past my break even point, and past any price for me to buy the option back.  I'll make over a month's pay, but I'm missing out on making over 5 month's worth.",1622837211.0
